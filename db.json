I\u2019m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager\u2019s take. We walk away with action items for next week\u2019s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I\u2019m at work at the client\u2019s office. They\u2019ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I\u2019m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we\u2019re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I\u2019m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride\u2019s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I\u2019m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we\u2019re retrospecting our last release. I\u2019ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I\u2019ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it\u2019s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day.

We\u2019re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n<p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot.
